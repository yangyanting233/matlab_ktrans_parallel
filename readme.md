# Matlab scripts for calculate Ktrans

Tha function for calculating Ktrans is in `funCalcCe.m`. `Permeability_estimation.m` is a gui interface which implements `funCalcCe.m`, developed by Joanne Lee (<pl2744@columbia.edu>). 

The main script is in `main_parallel.m`, developed by Yanting Yang (<yy3189@columbia.edu>), which is based on the `funCalcCe.m` and `Permeability_estimation.m`.

Read the `main_parallel.m` to learn how to modify and run the script.
